                The English department helps students acquire communicative competence and equips them with manners, etiquette, and soft skills to think creatively and critically. The department, headed by Dr A Anne Dorathy, has a dedicated team of qualified faculty members to help students become better orators and communicators by teaching them to overcome their inhibitions and master the four skills- LSRW (Listening, Speaking, Reading & Writing). Besides offering the regular courses, the team also trains the students for BEC- Business English Certificate exams and other competitive exams. The department runs a ‘Literary Club’ to support the students' extracurricular activities and a ‘Reading Hub’ to develop the students' reading skills.
