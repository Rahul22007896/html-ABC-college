            <h1>Mathematics</h1>
            <p>Mathematics differs from natural sciences. The physical theories in the sciences are tested by experiments, while mathematical statements are supported by proofs which may be verified objectively by mathematicians. If a certain statement is believed to be true by mathematicians (typically because special cases have been confirmed to some degree) but has neither been proven nor dis-proven, it is called a conjecture, as opposed to the ultimate goal: a theorem that is proven true. Physical theories may be expected to change whenever new information about our physical world is discovered. New ideas in Mathematics don't falsify old ones but rather are used to generalize what was known before to capture a broader range of phenomena.</p>
