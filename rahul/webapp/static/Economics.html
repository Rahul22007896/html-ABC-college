                The Economics Department is dedicated to teaching and research that helps business professionals and policymakers analyze resources and identify the most effective course of action.

                Economics is a uniquely powerful analytic framework for making sense of societyâ€”particularly the trends, patterns and choices made in times of uncertainty. Our program emphasizes the application of economics to the study of societal issues such as international trade, health care and taxation.
